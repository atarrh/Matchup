Matchup (V2.0)
=============

A simple PHP webapp that utilizes the Google Calendar API to help people
connect.

Server-side Installation
========================

Matchup uses the \*AMP stack - I am running arch linux and found 
[this article] (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-arch-linux) 
very helpful; those not running linux will have to configure their own
Apache/MySQL/PHP utilities.

You'll also need a redirect URL and the client.php file (one of the 'includes'
in the index file, which I'm hesitant to put on git).  Get in touch with me for
more deets.
